> Ionic components in a Piral instance

:zap: This sample uses Ionic components together with Piral.

Since the Ionic components are delivered in a way that only enables Webpack to understand their lazy loading desires we require to use `piral-cli-webpack` for bundling.

## Getting Started

After cloning make sure to have installed all dependencies:

```sh
npm i
```

## Running

After installing you can then trigger the Webpack dev server:

```sh
npm start
```

By default, the server is running at [localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234).
